## üìñ Detailed Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Root directory - install mock server dependencies
npm install

# Frontend directory - install React app dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

### Step 2: Start the Mock Server

The mock server uses Prism to simulate API responses based on the OpenAPI specification.

```bash
# Start Prism mock server on port 4010
npm run mock-server
```

**Important:** Keep this terminal running - the mock server must stay active for the demo to work.

### Step 3: Start the Frontend

```bash
# In a new terminal, start the React app
cd frontend
npm start
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 4: Run the Automated Demo

```bash
# Run Playwright tests (requires both servers running)
cd frontend
npx playwright test demo.spec.ts --project=chromium
```

### Step 5: View Test Results

```bash
# Open the interactive test report
npx playwright show-report
```

## üé¨ Demo Script Breakdown

The automated demo consists of 9 test scenarios:

1. **Application Overview** - Loads the main interface and verifies components
2. **Provider Tree Exploration** - Navigates through API providers and endpoints
3. **Cache Entry Selection** - Selects and loads a cache entry for editing
4. **JSON Response Editing** - Demonstrates editing capabilities with validation
5. **Testing Modifications** - Tests changes against the mock server
6. **Saving Changes** - Saves modifications to the cache
7. **Preview & Validation** - Shows preview functionality
8. **Complete Workflow** - End-to-end demonstration
9. **Error Handling** - Tests error scenarios and edge cases

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**‚ùå Tests failing with "Connection Error"**
- Ensure the mock server is running (`npm run mock-server`)
- Check that port 4010 is available
- Verify the OpenAPI spec file exists

**‚ùå Frontend not loading**
- Ensure you're in the `frontend` directory when running `npm start`
- Check that port 3000 is available
- Try clearing node_modules and reinstalling

**‚ùå Playwright tests not running**
- Install Playwright browsers: `npx playwright install`
- Ensure both servers are running before starting tests
- Check that the frontend is accessible at localhost:3000

### Manual Testing:

If automated tests fail, you can manually test the application:

1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
2. Verify the cache browser loads with statistics
3. Click on providers to explore endpoints
4. Select an endpoint to load it in the editor
5. Try editing the JSON content
6. Use the Test and Save buttons to validate functionality

## üöÄ Production Integration

The Tesseract Caching Editor is designed to work with both mock data (for development/testing) and real production cacheflow servers. This section explains how to integrate with your production cacheflow backend.

### Production vs Mock Mode

| Feature | Mock Mode | Production Mode |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Data Source** | Static OpenAPI examples | Real cached API responses |
| **Server** | Prism mock server (port 4010) | Cacheflow backend (port 8000) |
| **Proxy** | Not required | Node.js proxy server (port 4011) |
| **Authentication** | None required | May require API keys/tokens |
| **Data Volume** | Limited static examples | Full production cache data |
| **Persistence** | Changes lost on restart | Changes saved to production |

### üê≥ Production Docker Setup

For production deployment, use the provided Docker configuration:

```bash
# 1. Ensure cacheflow backend is running on port 8000
# (This should already be running in your environment)

# 2. Start production services
docker compose up -d

# 3. Access the frontend
# Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3666
# Production proxy will be available at: http://localhost:4011
```

### üîß Production Configuration

#### Environment Variables

The production setup uses these environment variables:

```bash
# Cacheflow Backend URL (default: http://host.docker.internal:8000)
CACHEFLOW_URL=http://your-cacheflow-server:8000

# Proxy Server Port (default: 4011)
PORT=4011

# Frontend Port (default: 3666)
FRONTEND_PORT=3666
```

#### Docker Compose Configuration

The `docker-compose.yml` file includes:

```yaml
# Production proxy server
production-proxy:
  image: node:20-alpine
  ports:
    - "4011:4011"
  volumes:
    - ./proxy-server.js:/app/proxy-server.js
    - ./package-proxy.json:/app/package.json
  environment:
    - CACHEFLOW_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8000
    - PORT=4011

# Production frontend
tesseract-frontend:
  build:
    context: ./frontend
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.demo
  ports:
    - "3666:80"
  depends_on:
    - production-proxy
```

### üåê API Endpoints

#### Production API Endpoints

The frontend connects to these production endpoints:

- **Cache Data**: `GET /admin/cache/organized`
  - Returns organized cache data by provider
  - Includes statistics and modification status

- **Entry Details**: `GET /admin/cache/entry?key={cache_key}`
  - Returns detailed entry information
  - Includes body, headers, metadata

- **Test Modifications**: `POST /admin/cache/test`
  - Tests modified responses against the cache
  - Validates JSON structure and content

- **Save Changes**: `PUT /admin/cache/entry`
  - Saves modifications to the production cache
  - Requires user authentication

#### Request/Response Examples

**Get Cache Data:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:4011/admin/cache/organized
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "name": "api.zoom.us",
      "host": "api.zoom.us",
      "endpoints": [...],
      "stats": {
        "total_entries": 8,
        "modified_count": 0
      }
    }
  ],
  "total_providers": 3,
  "total_entries": 13,
  "modified_entries": 1
}
```

### üîê Authentication & Security

#### Production Authentication

When connecting to production cacheflow:

1. **API Keys**: Configure authentication headers in `proxy-server.js`
2. **User Context**: Include user identification for audit trails
3. **Permissions**: Ensure proper access controls are in place

#### Security Headers

The proxy server includes security headers:
- CORS enabled for frontend access
- Error handling for failed requests
- Request logging for debugging

### üìä Production Monitoring

#### Health Checks

Both services include health endpoints:

```bash
# Frontend health
curl http://localhost:3666/health
# Returns: "healthy"

# Proxy health
curl http://localhost:4011/health
# Returns: {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"...","cacheflow_url":"..."}
```

#### Docker Health Checks

The Docker containers include automated health checks:
- Frontend: Checks nginx health endpoint
- Proxy: Checks proxy server health endpoint
- Both: 30-second intervals with 3 retries

### üß™ Production Testing

#### Running Tests in Production

```bash
# Update Playwright configuration for production
cd frontend
npx playwright test --project=chromium --base-url=http://localhost:3666
```

#### Test Data Validation

Production tests validate:
- Real cache data loading
- Actual API provider connections
- Production authentication flows
- Error handling with real services

### üö® Troubleshooting Production Issues

#### Common Production Issues

**‚ùå "Connection refused" errors**
- Verify cacheflow backend is running on port 8000
- Check network connectivity between containers
- Validate `CACHEFLOW_URL` environment variable

**‚ùå Authentication failures**
